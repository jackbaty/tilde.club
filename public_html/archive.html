<p>
This is a web page on the internet. It is nothing but basic, static HTML.
It's the simplest thing that could possibly work and
    I think it's beautiful.

<p>
Thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf">Paul Ford</a> for this whole <a href="http://tilde.club" target="_blank">tilde.club</a> thing.

<h2>Tuesday, November 22, 2022</h2>

I think I'll try to generate this file using Org-mode instead of editing the HTML by hand. I love plain HTML as much as you do, but I like Org-mode more.

<h2>Wednesday, October 20, 2021</h2>

Static sites are the best. I miss this one.

<h2>Welcome to 2021</h2>

Have I really been doing this since 2014?

<h2>Thursday, December 24, 2020</h2>

Feeling a little plain-ol' HTML today. I think I'll create some websites using just HTML, uncompressed CSS, no JavaScript, and not a single build tool.

<h2>Tuesday, October 27, 2020</h2>

I haven't been using Emacs at all for about 2 weeks. I think I'll be OK without it, but feels weird.

<h2>Wednesday, September 16, 2020</h2>

I'm writing this using a remote project set up in Panic's new <a href="https://nova.app">Nova</a> editor. Just because.

<h2>Tuesday, August 25, 2020</h2>

Ding ding hello hello?

<h2>Monday, March 09, 2020</h2>

I wish I wasn't so twitchy about COVID-19. Good thing I've been practicing "Social Isolation" for nearly 50 years already.

<h2>Thursday, January 01, 2020</h2>

Welcome to a new decade! Same as the old decade?

<h2>Friday, November 08, 2019</h2>

Neglecting this little tilde blog is fine. It's always here when I need it.

<h2>Thursday, October 03, 2019</h2>

What if I used a computer as a device through which I accomplished things rather than a toy to be tinkered with?

<h2>Tuesday, September 24, 2019</h2>

So I launched Mutt while in a shell on tilde.club and WHAM! I had email. From _outside_! I love Mutt so much. Send me
email if you want <a href="mailto:jbaty@tilde.club">jbaty@tilde.club</a>.

<h2>Wednesday, September 18, 2019</h2>

<p>Just posting tiny little occasional blog-like updates here is boring. I'll have to come up with something new</p>

<h2>Tuesday, September 17, 2019</h2>

There were 140 <a href="http://tilde.club/~delfuego/tilde.24h.html">recently modified pages</a> here on tilde.club at one point yesterday. How cool is that?!


<h2>Friday, September 13, 2019</h2>

<a href="https://medium.com/@antonmcclure/what-are-tildes-and-how-you-can-use-tilde-computing-4373bdabbc6a">What are 'Tildes'? - medium</a>

I love that we're still here.

Also...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A tildeverse-builder named Mike Buchholz (info@retrodigital.net) offered to take over <a href="https://t.co/RXxY0MEPYY">https://t.co/RXxY0MEPYY</a> AND the backlog of 10,000+ people who asked for accounts.

Neat!

<h2>Thursday, August 15, 2019</h2>

Now that Tumblr is owned by WordPress/Automaticc, should I use that too? Seems unavoidable :).

<h2>Wednesday, August 07, 2019</h2>

I happened to be here while changing the <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a> script so I thought I'd drop in and say hello.

<h2>Tuesday, May 14, 2019</h2>

Our humble host, Paul Ford, has a wonderful article in Wired...

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-we-love-tech-defense-difficult-industry/">Why I (Still) Love Tech: In Defense of a Difficult Industry</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Something about the interior life of a computer remains infinitely interesting to me; it‚Äôs not romantic, but it is a romance. You flip a bunch of microscopic switches really fast and culture pours out.</blockquote>

In it he talks a little about this server right here at tilde.club.

<blockquote><p>
The server is still up. Amazon sends a bill. I wish the party could have kept going.
</p>

<p>
But briefly I had made a tiny pirate kingdom, run at a small loss, where people were kind. It was the opposite of loneliness. And that is what I wish for the whole industry. Eternal September is not to be hated, but accepted as the natural order of success. We should invite everyone in. We should say, <em>We‚Äôre all new here</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

Thank you, Paul!

I'm moving stats from Fathom to <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible.io</a>. Neither of them
track user-identifiable information, but Plausible (released yesterday), is quite simple and fast. I'm willing to pay $6/month for simple and fast.

<h2>Saturday, March 23, 2019</h2>

<a href="https://espressoapp.com/">Espresso</a> is included in <a href="https://setapp.com/">SetApp</a>. Could be just the ticket for static sites (such as this one).
If I wanted something fancier, that is.

<h2>Saturday, March 02, 2019</h2>

I would rather not let a whole month go buy without at least a tiny update here. Where did February go? Anyway, welcome to March. I hope it's a good one for you.

<h2>Wednesday, January 23, 2019</h2>

Having so much fun with <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">Tiddlywiki</a> at <a href="https://rudimentarylathe.org/">rudimentarylathe.org</a> I can't stand it.

<h2>Saturday, January 12, 2019</h2>

This is a test. I'm editing this file via Tramp in Emacs from my local machine (iMac). Clever bastard, that Emacs!

<h2>Monday, January 07, 2019</h2>

I sometimes forget about this little site at tilde.club. It came up while speaking with Jean MacDonald on the <a href="https://monday.micro.blog/2019/01/06/episode-jack-baty.html">Micro Monday Podcast</a>. I still love a static HTML page on a server.

I had the most fun with it when I was using Fargo for "snippets" and publishing them here. e.g. <a href="/~jbaty/2014/">My snippets from 2014</a>.

<h2>Wednesday, November 07, 2018</h2>

<p>I'm also experimenting with a TiddlyWiki wiki at <a href="https://rudimentarylathe.org/">rudimentarylathe.org</a></p>


<h2>Tuesday, May 15, 2018</h2>

<p>Seeing a few posts about how The Web Is Headed The Wrong Direction and whatnot. Reminds me to drop in here at tilde.club for a breath of fresh air.</p>

<h2>Friday, February 02, 2018</h2>

<p>
Today <a href="https://micro.blog/gio">gio</a> pointed out the similarity in feel between
<a href="http://tilde.club/">Tilde.club</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>. Shortly thereafter, a few
more Micro.blog users chimed to say they'd loved Tilde.club and that Micro.blog did indeed feel much like it. How fun!
</p>

<h2>Saturday, November 25, 2017</h2>

<p>
Hey, look who's confused again about what to use to publish his website. <a href="https://www.baty.net/2017/wordpress-is-a-typewriter/">WordPress is a Typewriter</a>
</p>

<h2>Sunday, October 15, 2017</h2>

<p>
Having fun playing with <a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">twtxt</a>, a "Decentralised, minimalist microblogging service for hackers". I don't imagine it'll get used much, but I like the idea. Mine is at <a href="http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt">tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt</a>.

<h2>Friday, October 13, 2017 and I'm just hanging out here via my iPad</h2>

I'm editing this document via SSH/mosh using blink.sh on my iPad. What a fabulous combination of modern and retro! Each time I add something here I feel such a pang of, I don't know, regret maybe? I <em>liked</em> doing things this way. Still do.


<h2>Richard Stallman - "How I do my computing"</h2>

<blockquote>
I edit the pages on this site with Emacs also, although volunteer helpers install the political notes and urgent notes. I have no experience with other ways of maintaining web sites. In principle I would be glad to know about other ways, but learning about them is low priority for me and I have other things to do.
</blockquote>

Stallman edits his page the same way I edit this tilde.club page. This is about the only thing we have in common. I love re-reading <a href="https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html">his process notes</a> every once in a while.


<h2>Sunday, August 6, 2017</h2>

I just discovered <a href=‚Äúhttp://www.blink.sh/‚Äú>Blink Shell</a> and that means I‚Äòm typing this on my 10.5‚Äù iPad Pro in an ssh session and <em>that</em> means I‚Äòm pretty happy right now.

This ~tilde document is as good a place as any to test the new <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit 5</a>.

<h2>Tuesday, October 04, 2016</h2>

I read an article today: <a
href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.rexhehtlr">How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016</a>
<p>
It reminded me of this little hand-made, simple, static tilde.club page.

<h2>Sunday, July 03, 2016</h2>

<p>
  I've been thinking a lot about the fate of things and the "independent web".
  The recent article from The Awl by Charles Thaxton struck a chord: <a href="https://theawl.com/how-does-it-look-d04fdd098b62#.u2qiz3byk">Wither the Webpage</a>

  <blockquote>
    So to what extent does the way a site looks impact what a site is? This
    question might have to be re-legislated again. What seems certain is that
    fewer discrete pages means fewer discrete voices, and further ensures that
    the internet becomes primarily a vehicle for reaction (and all the ugliness
    of a purely reactionary culture) rather than creation.
  </blockquote>

I wanted to link to our generous tilde.club host's article in New Republic and thought
it fitting to do so here. So...

<h2>Sunday, April 10, 2016</h2>

Hello again, my little tilde.club page. It's nice to see you.


<h2>Saturday January 30, 2016</h2>

I just updated this page because I don't want tilde.club to go away. Is it helping?

<h2>Saturday September 26, 2015</h2>

<p>It feels like this shouldn't be a blog. Maybe a single-page summary of who-knows-what. I'll think about it.</p>

<p>We're coming up on a year of this tilde.club thing, no?</p>

<h2>Sunday August 30, 2015</h2>

I've spent much of the weekend going all-in with static websites.
<a href="http://baty.net/" target="_blank">My blog</a> has been
converted from Wordpress to <a href="http://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a>.
Most of my online presence now requires nothing but a simple web server serving static HTML pages.
Feels much more permanent this way and I like it.

<h2>Saturday August 29, 2015</h2>

<p>
I've decided to move the snippets blog over to my own domain. It's now at
<a href="http://snippets.baty.net/">snippets.baty.net</a>.
</p>

<p>
I'll do something with this page at some point. Probably as a way
to test some new static blogging engine or another.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I'm still at...
